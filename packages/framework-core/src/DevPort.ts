/**
 * Allocate a concrete ephemeral port for a framework dev server.
 *
 * Frameworks (and the listeners under them — Vite, listhen/get-port-please,
 * `next dev`) treat `port: 0` as "no port given" and fall back to hunting
 * upward from their well-known default (3000/4321/5173). Those defaults are
 * exactly where users configure their `alchemy dev` proxy ports, so a
 * framework child hunting from its default can land on — or IPv6-shadow —
 * a port the user is browsing. Probing a real ephemeral port from the OS
 * keeps dev servers out of user-visible port ranges entirely.
 *
 * The tiny probe→listen race is handled by the caller passing the port with
 * non-strict semantics: on a genuine collision the framework moves to the
 * next port, still in the ephemeral range.
